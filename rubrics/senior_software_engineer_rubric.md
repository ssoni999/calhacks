## Notes for Reviewers

1. **Seniority is critical** - Don't compromise on leadership for this role
2. **System design skills are essential** - Not just implementation
3. **Look for impact and scale** - Did they build systems or just features?
4. **Leadership indicators** - Mentorship, technical decisions, process improvements
5. **Recent technology adoption** - Are they keeping skills current?
6. **Trade-off thinking** - Do they explain why they chose certain approaches?
