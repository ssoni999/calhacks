## Notes for Reviewers

1. **AWS is highly preferred** - GCP/Azure acceptable but AWS strongly desired
2. **Kubernetes is essential** - Cannot be weak in K8s for this role
3. **Automation mindset** - Look for evidence of "I automated X to save time"
4. **Production experience matters** - Not just lab/tutorial work
5. **On-call experience** - Shows production responsibility
6. **Scripting is critical** - Must be comfortable coding automation
7. **Security awareness** - Should mention security best practices
8. **Cost consciousness** - Should think about infrastructure costs
